### The challenge

The challenge was to build out this 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

- identifing elements
- building the html sturcture
- giving names to elements for styling using BEM
- styling (reset, width&flow, fonts, padding & margin, colors, fine-tuning the rest)
- responsive design

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### Continued development

I'd like to continue focusing on responsive design in future projects. This is what I'm still not completely comfortable with and what I want to refine and perfect.
