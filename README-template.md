### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I'd like to continue focusing on responsive design in future projects. This is what I'm still not completely comfortable with and what I want to refine and perfect.
